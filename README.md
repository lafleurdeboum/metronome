# metronome.py

A script that uses python, python-mingus and fluidsynth to reproduce a tone at any regular rate

## Installation

You will need `python` (called `python2` under Arch), `python-mingus` and `fluidsynth` to use this script. Then just download and run the script.

## Usage

The syntax is :

  `metronome.py [tempo]`

where tempo is an optional integer expressed in beats per minute (bpm). If it is ommited, the tempo will be 80.
